	<p class="center">EPISODE IV<br />THE PUMPKIN SPICE MUST FLOW</p>

	<p>48,000 years into the future.</p>

  <p>The pumpkins are fed up with evil mistreatment by the human race. They
  have forged a rebellion and are exploring outer space through the power of
  the highly addictive Pumpkin Spice. They hope to find a new home for
  pumpkins, but different species of pumpkin do not agree on a single
  homeworld, thus the emergence of Pumpkin Houses.</p>

  <p>Two primary houses vie for supremacy over the Spice. House Latte is light,
  virtuous, fluffy and kind. House Pie, however, is heavy, vicious, and highly
  calorific. To quell their century-long rivalry, The Great Pumpkin has ordered
  them to travel to the lone world where this resource can be found: the planet
  Seattle, also known as...</p>

  <p class="center">STARBUCKS.</p>

<p>A war of sugar, a war of spice, a war of nothing and everything nice, reigns on Starbucks, whose landscape has been slowly destroyed by armies of self-described indigenous peoples: the Hipsters. “We were here before this place was even a Starbucks,” they often claim. In reality they are being tricked-or-mistreated by the pumpkins to conscript for their respective slave armies.</p>

<p>The House Latte has invented the sugar eradicator mega-weapon to counter the House Pie’s Attack-O-Lantern. Sugar eradicator makes House Pie less fattening, and therefore less dense, which makes it less wildly popular among the morbidly obese.</p>

<p>House Pie has retaliated by unleashing the highly addictive Attack-O-Lantern Trenta Cold, which is on average at least 1.5 times as potent as the largest Latte. Within three days of the weapon’s release several dozen Hipsters reportedly became more morbidly obese. Thus the House Pie’s numbers grew as it seems to be gaining an edge….</p>

<p>So House Latte released the Sugar-Free PSL, whose chemical properties make it more deliciously satisfying and less guilt-laden than the Attack-O-Lantern, and therefore even more addictive for Hipsters. Within three days of the release, several dozen Hipsters reportedly "got abs”.</p>
